The Google Play Store team aims to develop a feature that boosts visibility for the most promising apps by identifying the key factors contributing to their performance. To achieve this, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the relationship between app attributes — such as size, price, number of installs, and ratings — and overall app success.

Key questions to address:

Does a higher app size or price directly correlate with better app performance compared to other apps?
Is the number of installs a reliable indicator of app ratings, or are there other hidden factors driving user satisfaction?
The goal is to uncover data-driven insights that help prioritize app visibility strategies, ensuring that high-potential apps gain the recognition they deserve.
